# Beat Saber: Flying Car Enabler
A very simple plugin to globally enable the Flying Cars easter egg.

**NOTE:** This functionality is also included in [BeatSaberTweaks](https://github.com/taz030485/BeatSaberTweaks). If you want extra features such as an in-game clock, moveable energy bar, note hit volume control and more then I *highly* recommend using that instead.  
If you're not interested in all that and just want some cool flying cars, then this lightweight plugin is for you.

## Installation
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/lolPants/BeatSaber-FlyingCars/releases) and extract to your Beat Saber install directory.  
You should end up with the DLL inside the `Plugins/` folder if done correctly.

## Thanks
* **taz030485:** Releasing BeatSaberTweaks which a lot of code was re-used for me to learn to make a plugin. :heart:
